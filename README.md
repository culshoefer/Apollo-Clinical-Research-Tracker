#Clinical Research Tracker

This repo contains the front-end and back-end source code for the Clinical Research Tracker. Made by UCL Comp Sci students in 2016. 

## Note about `apollo-app`

To decrease the amount of files transfered to the repository the folder `node_modules` is ignored by Git, hence the app will not run out of the box. Make sure to run `npm install` before `npm start` to start the lite server. If you're just opening `index.html` directly, you shouldn't encounter any problems.
